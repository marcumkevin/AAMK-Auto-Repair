## AAMK Auto Repair App

Welcome to my final capstone project with Tech Elevator! In a small team of 3, we created a single-page web application (with Vue.js, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL) to allow customers to submit a vehicle repair request and employees to generate a corresponding work order by setting an itemized list of repairs, parts and labor costs, and a pick-up time when completed.

Please feel free to view the project at:

If you create a new account, it will be a customer account. If you log in as 'admin'/'password', there is a link to create an employee account (or you can view the employee functionality as the admin). Different options for customer and employee interactions exist when viewing a work order's details, depending on whether the repair list has been created, whether the work order has been approved by the employee, and whether the work order has been mark paid and completed.
