## AAMK Auto Repair App

Welcome to my final capstone project with Tech Elevator! In a small team of 3, we created a single-page web application (with Vue.js, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL) to allow customers to submit a vehicle repair request and employees to generate a corresponding work order by setting an itemized list of repairs, parts and labor costs, and a pick-up time when completed.

### Credits
- Andrea Abaunza and Max Garnot, my partner programmers
- Tech Elevator, for the 14 weeks of instruction
